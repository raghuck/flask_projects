PS5 Game Library Website:

This is a website which displays games for you to buy. Better description will be added 
later during final commit.

Important:
1. Since this is created on a linux system,it is advised to import only the folders sqlite3,
static ,templates and app.py. Then create a new virtual environment and install flask in the env.
2. sql_manage.py is a temporary python file to maintain the sql databases. It is not necessary
to import.
3. I'm new to this, especially html and bootstrap. The code can be a bit messy and hard to 
understand.
4. If you are facing issues trying to run this, or you feel certain parts can be executed better,
kindly contact me at my email tanushmal@gmail.com

Note to self:
1. base.html header code can be improved
2. index.html needs better carousel feature
3. Overall website design can be updated to feel like 2020 and not 2013.
4. app.py can be improved to work better, even though I spent 2 whole days trying to do the same.
SQL joins need to be used.
5. Code refactoring (especially app.py its really messy)
